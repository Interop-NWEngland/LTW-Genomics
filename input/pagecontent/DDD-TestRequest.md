A detailed description of this archetype which includes mappings to HL7 FHIR can be found [NHS England North-West Genomics Order Panel](Questionnaire-GenomicOrderPanel.html). This is also a minimal dataset based on `NHS Genomics MDM`

This also includes messaging concepts which are described in this guide to add compatibility with HL7 v2 and IHE LTW.
